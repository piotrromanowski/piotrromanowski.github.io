# New Redesign!

Yes, you read that correctly, but hopefully for the last time. I've decided
to move my website to [hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/) so that blogging is
less tedious.

The history of this website....

I started with the original website back sometime in 2013 when I started my
first software engineering job. Back then, the website was hosted on digital
ocean as a [Play!](https://www.playframework.com/) app. My original intentions
for maintaining a website was to continue learning about whatever framework
I was currently using, and to learn how to host a website.

Since then then website was rewritten using various frameworks, languages, and
hosting services. Each time I started learning a new front-end framework, I rewrote
parts of the website using that tech. (Ember, Angular, React, etc...) I did the
same as I learned new back-end languages.

One downside of all this rewriting is that I lost much of the original posts,
and that I would often rewrite the website, and then not produce much new content.
I hope to change that now that I've switched to hosting the blog on github using
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Some of the blog posts that you'll find on here will include:

- random tech musings
- home renovations/hacks
- life updates
- and whatever else that comes to my mind worth blabbering about

Hope you stick around!
